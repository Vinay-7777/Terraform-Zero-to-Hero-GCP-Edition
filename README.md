# Terraform-Zero-to-Hero-GCP-Edition

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Terraform on GCP

Introduction to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

In this session, we introduce the core concepts of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Understand how Terraform simplifies infrastructure provisioning and automation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), making cloud resource management scalable, repeatable, and version-controlled.

Installing Terraform on MacOS, Linux, and Windows

Learn how to install Terraform across different operating systems. This section includes step-by-step instructions and verification commands to ensure a smooth setup experience, regardless of your platform.

Setting up Terraform for GCP

Dive into Google Cloud integration with Terraform. Learn how to authenticate using service accounts, configure the google provider, and prepare your environment to start provisioning GCP resources through Terraform.

Writing Your First Terraform Code

Start writing your first Terraform configuration. Understand the structure of .tf files, how to define GCP resources using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), and run your first Terraform commands to provision infrastructure.

Understanding the Terraform Lifecycle

Explore the Terraform lifecycle in detail:

terraform init: Initialize a Terraform working directory.

terraform plan: Preview infrastructure changes before applying.

terraform apply: Apply the desired infrastructure state.

terraform destroy: Tear down resources.
Understand when and why to use each command in real-world scenarios.

Launching a Compute Engine VM on GCP

Level up your Terraform skills by provisioning a Compute Engine VM instance in GCP. Configure key attributes like machine type, zone, boot disk, and network settings.
